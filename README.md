Title: Python Informative Website

I want to make a Python informative website. On this website I wanted it to be informative and give information on why you should take computer science. I want to add pictures and add lots of text. I also want to add a navigation bar to make it easier to switch through pages.

Goal: my goal is to finish my project or somewhat finish my project just enough so that I have images and a navigation bar

Technology: The technology I will be using is FLask, HTML, CSS, and possible SQL
